<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>
My name is Hongshen Chen (陈宏申), and I am a research scientist with Data Science Lab, JD.com. I also serve as a Youth Committee of CCF TCCI (Technical Committee of Chinese Information, China Computer Federation). I received my Ph.D. from <a href="http://nlp.ict.ac.cn/"> NLP Group </a>, <a href="http://www.ict.ac.cn/">Institute of Computing Technology</a>, <a href="http://www.ucas.ac.cn/"> Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>, advised by Prof. Qun Liu. Prior to that, I receieved my B.E. from <a href="http://www.scu.edu.cn/">Sichuan University</a> in 2012 and worked as a short-term research assistant at <a href=" https://www.sutd.edu.sg/"> Singapore University of Technology and Design </a>  with Prof. <a href=" https://frcchang.github.io/ "> Yue Zhang </a>, 2016. Currently, I am focusing on natural language processing, dialogue systems, machine translation, sequence labelling, etc. I won <a href="http://www.ict.cas.cn/xwzx/jssxw/201611/t20161118_4698322.html">best paper award</a> on CCL 2016.
<br><br>

I maintain a list of my publications under the <a href="/publications/">Publications</a> tab, and a list of projects under the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. You may also check out my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6IjAsIUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Google Scholar profile.</a> <br><br>

To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae</a>. I blog (although quite less frequently) and pin them down <a href="/blog">here</a>.
