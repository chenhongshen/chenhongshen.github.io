# Hongshen Chen's Homepage
This is Hongshen Chen's Homepage, orgined from  *Academic Portfolio*, a one-stop, clean and minimal mobile-friendly Jekyll theme for your academic homepage. I created it for my own homepage, borrowing elements from Steve Miller's [no-good-very-bad](https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template) template, and modifying style and layout to fit my personal needs.
